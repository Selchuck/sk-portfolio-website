### About



A graduate of Le Wagon London, a bootcamp teaching **Full-Stack** Ruby on Rails.

Before my devotion to computer programming, I did years of professional work in hospitality industry where Iâ€™ve picked up key skills including ***communication***, ***teamwork*** and ***customer service***. I'm now exploring various roles in web development looking to make tech industry a home.

As a career changer I believe I am abnormaly driven with a frightening big appetite, and now want to join a team to build ***exciting***, ***elegant*** and ***responsive*** websites and applications for any sector where good user-friendly **design** makes a difference!
